# Jenkinsfile

A Jeninsfile is a method for automating the process of setting up a pipeline in jenkins. A Jenkinsfile contains the definition of a Jenkins Pipeline in steps and is checked into source control to be used by jenkins. 

### Example Jenkinsfile
```
pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                echo 'Building..'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                echo 'Testing..'
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                echo 'Deploying....'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This Jenkinsfile will create a Pipeline with 3 stages:
1. Build
2. Test
3. Deploy

# Deliverable

Using your Jenkins and Nexus instances from 4.3, implement a Jenkinsfile to automate your pipeline. 

- For the three projects spring-petclinic, joda-time hibernate, and junit your projects should build, test, and deploy each to Nexus.
